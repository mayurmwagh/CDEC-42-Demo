1. Namespace

A namespace in Kubernetes is like a logical cluster within a cluster.

It‚Äôs used to divide cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or environments.

üîπ Key points:

Helps organize and isolate resources.

Each namespace can have its own resources (pods, services, deployments, etc.).

Default namespaces:

default ‚Üí for general workloads.

kube-system ‚Üí for system-related components.

kube-public ‚Üí public resources accessible by all users.

kube-node-lease ‚Üí heartbeats for node availability.

üëâ Example: You may use

dev namespace for development,

test for testing,

prod for production.

# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace dev

# Run pod in a namespace
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n dev

2. ReplicationController (RC)

Old mechanism in Kubernetes for ensuring a specified number of pod replicas are running.

If a pod fails, the ReplicationController will create a new one.

üîπ Key features:

Ensures desired number of pod replicas are always running.

Supports scaling up/down.

Limited selector capability (only equality-based selectors).

üëâ Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx-rc
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx


‚ö†Ô∏è ReplicationController is deprecated and replaced by ReplicaSet.

3. ReplicaSet (RS)

The newer and improved version of ReplicationController.

Does everything RC does, but with advanced selectors.

üîπ Key differences vs. RC:

Supports set-based selectors (e.g., in, notin, exists).

Is the default workload manager used under Deployments.

Ensures self-healing (maintains desired replica count).

üëâ Example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values:
          - nginx
          - web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: rs-example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: env
        operator: In
        values:
          - prod
          - staging
      - key: tier
        operator: NotIn
        values:
          - frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        env: prod
        tier: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx




apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-rs
  labels:
    name: demo-app
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: demo-container
          image: httpd:latest 
          ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 80
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-app

  replicas: 5




üîπ What are selectors in Kubernetes?

Selectors define which pods belong to a ReplicaSet/Deployment/Service.

Equality-based selectors ‚Üí key = value, key != value

Set-based selectors ‚Üí in, notin, exists, doesnotexist

Equality selectors are simple, but set-based selectors are more flexible.

üîπ Set-based selectors examples
1. in

Matches if the label‚Äôs value is in a given list.

selector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: env
      operator: In
      values:
        - dev
        - test


üëâ This will select pods with labels:

env=dev OR env=test

2. notin

Matches if the label‚Äôs value is NOT in the given list.

selector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: tier
      operator: NotIn
      values:
        - frontend


üëâ This will select pods where tier label is anything except frontend.

3. exists

Matches if the label key is present, regardless of value.

selector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: app
      operator: Exists


üëâ This will select pods that have an app label, no matter what value it has.

4. doesnotexist

Matches if the label key is missing.

selector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: debug
      operator: DoesNotExist


üëâ This will select pods that do not have the debug label at all.

üîπ Example ReplicaSet using set-based selectors
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: rs-example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: env
        operator: In
        values:
          - prod
          - staging
      - key: tier
        operator: NotIn
        values:
          - frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        env: prod
        tier: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx


üëâ This ReplicaSet will select pods where:

env is either prod OR staging

tier is NOT frontend




1. Deployments vs StatefulSets

Kubernetes offers different controllers to manage Pods depending on application needs.

Deployment

Use Case: Stateless applications (e.g., web servers, APIs).

Pod Identity: Pods are interchangeable, no fixed identity.

Scaling: Easy horizontal scaling, any Pod can serve traffic.

Storage: Usually uses emptyDir or shared Persistent Volumes.

Updates: Supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

üëâ Example apps: Nginx, Apache, Frontend UI, REST APIs.

StatefulSet

Use Case: Stateful applications (e.g., databases, Kafka, Redis).

Pod Identity: Each Pod has a unique, sticky identity (e.g., pod-0, pod-1).

Scaling: Pods created in order (0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2) and terminated in reverse order.

Storage: Uses PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for stable storage.

Updates: Ordered, controlled updates.

üëâ Example apps: MySQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, Elasticsearch.

Key Differences
Feature	Deployment (Stateless)	StatefulSet (Stateful)
Pod Identity	Random, interchangeable	Stable, ordered
Scaling	Simple, fast	Sequential, careful
Storage	Shared/ephemeral	Dedicated Persistent Volumes
Use Cases	Web servers, APIs	Databases, Queues, Caches
Update Strategy	Rolling updates	Ordered updates

2. YAML Manifests
Deployment Manifest (Nginx Example)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80



StatefulSet Manifest (MySQL Example)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "mysql"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-data
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: root123
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mysql-data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi



3. DaemonSet
What is a DaemonSet?

A DaemonSet ensures that one Pod runs on every (or selected) node in the cluster.
Whenever a new node is added, the DaemonSet automatically schedules a Pod on it.

Use Cases

Running cluster-wide agents:

Log collection agents (Fluentd, Logstash, Filebeat)

Monitoring agents (Prometheus Node Exporter, Datadog Agent)

Networking components (CNI plugins, kube-proxy)

DaemonSet Manifest (Node Exporter Example)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-exporter
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-exporter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-exporter
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-exporter
        image: prom/node-exporter
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9100







4. Teaching Flow (How to Explain in Class)

Start with analogy

Deployment: Like a food court where all counters serve the same food.

StatefulSet: Like a bank locker ‚Äì each locker (Pod) has a fixed identity.

DaemonSet: Like a security guard on each floor of a building.

Show diagrams

Deployment: identical Pods behind a load balancer.

StatefulSet: ordered Pods with storage.

DaemonSet: one Pod per node.

Hands-on exercise

Deploy an Nginx Deployment.

Deploy a MySQL StatefulSet.

Deploy a Node Exporter DaemonSet.

üëâ Would you like me to also create diagrams/visual slides for these (Deployment vs StatefulSet vs DaemonSet) so your trainers can use them while teaching?
